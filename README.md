# Seven Data

_This project was **NOT** developed with broad adoption or adaptation for third-party use in mind. Its format and logic are highly specific to the original use case._

This repository contains the frontend for a simple website that processes a .zip file containing a WhatsApp chat history. It is intended to extract specific information on sales and quantities to provide a clear overview and quick analysis over the years.

## Why?

For a few years this business would keep track of daily expenses and sales on a WhatsApp group chat (yeah). After some time it became challenging to properly analyze the data, prompting the creation of this tool.

## Shouldn't you keep it private?

* The repository is public solely to enable the use of GitHub Pages, allowing quick access to the tool for a couple of users.
* The code does not contain sensitive or confidential information, as it is generic enough not to expose any personal data.
* All of the processing is client-side.
